    <h1>About Me: A Journey of Rebuilding and Growth</h1>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to Pied Piper Healthy Living! My name is Marcus Piper, and I am 46 years old, living in Alexandria, Virginia, with my wonderful wife. I grew up in Houston, Texas, and have always been enthusiastic about the importance of health, wellness, and personal growth.</p>

    <h2 id="start_journey">The Start of My Journey</h2>
    <p>Growing up in Houston, I come from a large family with seven siblings, raised by three different women. I’m number four in a family of three girls and four boys. Life in "The Hood" wasn’t always easy, but it taught me resilience and the importance of staying grounded in faith. I’m a proud Christian—my faith is one of the strongest parts of who I am.</p>

    <h2 id="marriage_family">Marriage and Family</h2>
    <p>I’ve been married to my amazing wife for nearly eight years. We met in San Antonio, built a strong relationship, and together we’ve raised three incredible children—two daughters (20 and 18) and a son who’s 14. My wife and I attend church regularly, and our faith has helped us navigate both joyful and challenging moments in life.</p>

    <h2 id="life_journey">Fitness, Community & Personal Growth</h2>
    <p>I’m passionate about fitness. I work out 5–6 days a week, not just for physical wellness, but for mental clarity and stability. That commitment has played a major role in rebuilding my life. I’ve also returned to college—currently enrolled in my first year of the Information Systems Technology program. At 46, I’m learning firsthand that growth never stops.</p>

    <p>I keep a small circle of close friends—Roderick and Lenny—who’ve supported me on this journey. Community is everything. You don’t have to do this alone.</p>

    <h2>Let’s Grow Together</h2>
    <p>Whether you're rebuilding from a setback, or simply working toward balance, I believe we can grow stronger—together. Feel free to explore the <a href="healthy_living_tips.html">Healthy Living Tips</a> and <a href="rebuild_rebrand.html">Rebuild & Rebrand</a> pages and connect with the journey.</p>
